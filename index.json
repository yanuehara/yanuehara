IIoT objects poses the challenge of distributing and managing task allocation among them. The fairness of task allocation brings flexible network reconfiguration and maximizes the tasks to be performed. Although existing approaches optimize and manage the dynamics of objects, not all them consider both co-relationship between tasks and object capabilities and the distributed allocation over the cluster service. This paper introduces the ACADIA mechanism for task allocation in IIoT networks in order to distribute task among objects. It relies on relational consensus strategies to allocate tasks and similarity capabilities to determine which objects can play in accomplishing those tasks. Evaluation on NS-3 showed that ACADIA achieved 98% of allocated tasks in an IIoT-Health considering all scenarios, average more than 95% of clusters apt to performed tasks in a low response time, and achieved 50% more effectiveness in task allocation compared to the literature solution CONTASKI.","tags":["Task Allocation","Cooperative Management","IIoT-Health","Consensus"],"title":"Relational Consensus-Based Cooperative Task Allocation Management for IIoT-Health Networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Carlos Pedroso","Yan Uehara","Michele Nogueira","Aldri Santos"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1607299200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1615128251,"objectID":"e62e5b8352e62b355791ddec67bf32c8","permalink":"https://yanuehara.dev/publication/pedroso-junior-2020/","publishdate":"2020-12-07T14:44:10.938053Z","relpermalink":"/publication/pedroso-junior-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"Entre os atuais serviços IoT destacam-se os voltados a indústrias, que muitas vezes exigem que os objetos desempenhem mais de uma tarefa. Entretanto, o crescimento exponencial dos objetos na IoT impõe o desafio de distribuir e gerenciar a alocação de tarefas entre os objetos. Um dos principais objetivos da alocação de tarefas é melhorar a qualidade das informações e a maximização de tarefas a serem executadas. Embora existam abordagens que otimizem e gerenciem a dinamicidade dos nós, nem todas consideram a relação de similaridade a alocação distribuída sobre o serviço de agrupamento. Este trabalho propõe um mecanismo chamado CONTASKI para alocação de tarefas em redes IIoT, a fim de distribuir as tarefas entre os objetos. Ele baseia-se em estratégias de consenso relacional para alocar as tarefas e de similaridade de capacidades para determinar quais objetos podem atuar na realização dessas tarefas. O CONTASKI foi avaliado no NS-3 gerenciando um ambiente IIoT e obteve uma eficiência de cerca de 98% de tarefas alocadas na maioria dos cenários avaliados e mais de 80% dos agrupamentos IIoT aptos a executá-las.","tags":["Alocação de Tarefas","Consenso","Agrupamento","Gerência Cooperativa","Task Allocation","Consensus","Cooperative Management"],"title":"Atribuições Cooperativas de Tarefas de Sensoriamento Baseada em Consenso Relacional para Redes IIoT","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Carlos Pedroso","Yan Uehara","Michele Nogueira","Aldri Santos"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1602460800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1615128251,"objectID":"d1b500e5e304fca1393d04049c23cced","permalink":"https://yanuehara.dev/publication/pedroso-2020/","publishdate":"2020-10-12T14:44:11.021486Z","relpermalink":"/publication/pedroso-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"Current IoT services include industry-oriented services, which often require objects to run more than one task.
